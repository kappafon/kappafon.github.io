    <h1>H. P. Lovecraft <small>(1890 â€“ 1937)</small></h1>

    <p id="tribute-info"><strong>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</strong> was an American writer who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. He was relatively unknown during his own time. Not many knew his name. He did, however, correspond regularly
      with other contemporary writers, who became good friends of his, even though they never met in person. Greatly influencing work in their respective fields. He died in poverty, but is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors
      in his genre.</p>
    <p>Lovecraft created a number of fictional deities throughout the course of his literary career, including the <em>"Great Old Ones"</em> and aliens, such as the <em>"Elder Things"</em>, with sporadic references to other miscellaneous deities.</p>

    <p><strong>Cthulhu</strong> is one such entity. Considered a Great Old One. Lovecraft depicts Cthulhu as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists. Its appearance is described as looking like an octopus, a dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name
      was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe where it and its fellow entities existed, the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>
    <p>Lovecraft and his stories have had a profound impact on popular culture and have been praised by many modern writers . He has influenced fiction authors worldwide, and Lovecraftian elements can be seen in novels, movies, comic books, even cartoons.</p>
