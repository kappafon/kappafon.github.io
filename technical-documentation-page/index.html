                <p>
                    The ASHPD is a hand-held device which has the ability to manufacture two linked portals. No matter the distance between
                    them, any object which passes through one portal will emerge from the other and vice versa instantaneously. The portals
                    can be placed on any surface which is made out of manufactured or refined moon rock and large enough to accommodate
                    them. Moving objects, or certain types of surfaces, will usually prevent the formation of a portal. Material
                    Emancipation Grills will block any attempt to shoot portals through them, as well as reset any active portals should the
                    ASHPD pass through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ASHPD is held with a hand behind the weapon, holding the handle/trigger, while the other hand supports the barrel. A
                    light in the small hole on the top of the ASHPD and its glowing glass tube both have the color of the last portal shot.
                    It has two triggers, one for each of its two portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the ASHPD is fired, a burst of colored energy is emitted from the barrel, corresponding to the colored portal it is
                    intended to create. Upon striking the targeted surface, a portal is formed, surrounded by a colored ring. If the surface
                    cannot accommodate a portal for whatever reason, the shot will dissipate in a shower of colored particles. If one portal
                    is shot into its opposite, the portal will be formed next to the first one, assuming the surface has enough room for it
                    to form; otherwise, it will dissipate as normal. The device can only create two portals at a time. If a third is fired,
                    the other of its type will be automatically closed and a new link will be formed.
                </p>
                <code
                    >The portals fired by the ASHPD each have a distinct color. Chell's ASHPD uses blue and orange (Or red if you look in
                    the settings) portals. ATLAS and P-body each use a variant on those two colors; ATLAS uses light blue and purple
                    portals, while P-body uses yellow and red portals.</code
                >
                <p>
                    The ASHPD also has a zero-point energy field manipulator, similar to the Gravity Gun but far weaker. It can pick up
                    objects, but only those directly in front of it. If the space between the object and the ASHPD is interrupted by a solid
                    object, there is a chance that the object will be dropped, which can sometimes occur when traveling through portals at
                    high velocity and the object accidentally hits the edge of the portal or another object in the surrounding area. It also
                    cannot punt them as the Gravity Gun can, so the only way to throw the object is to physically swing the ASHPD itself,
                    which can at best send the object a few meters away. It cannot catch Aperture Science High Energy Pellets, the
                    equivalent of Combine Energy Balls, due to the weaker manipulator. Items picked up with the ASHPD's manipulator can be
                    carried though portals, which proves to be very useful in several test chambers.
