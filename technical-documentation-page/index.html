            <section id="Overview" class="main-section">
                <header>Overview</header>
                <p>
                    The ASHPD is a hand-held device which has the ability to manufacture two linked portals. No matter the distance between
                    them, any object which passes through one portal will emerge from the other and vice versa instantaneously. The portals
                    can be placed on any surface which is made out of manufactured or refined moon rock and large enough to accommodate
                    them. Moving objects, or certain types of surfaces, will usually prevent the formation of a portal. Material
                    Emancipation Grills will block any attempt to shoot portals through them, as well as reset any active portals should the
                    ASHPD pass through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ASHPD is held with a hand behind the weapon, holding the handle/trigger, while the other hand supports the barrel. A
                    light in the small hole on the top of the ASHPD and its glowing glass tube both have the color of the last portal shot.
                    It has two triggers, one for each of its two portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the ASHPD is fired, a burst of colored energy is emitted from the barrel, corresponding to the colored portal it is
                    intended to create. Upon striking the targeted surface, a portal is formed, surrounded by a colored ring. If the surface
                    cannot accommodate a portal for whatever reason, the shot will dissipate in a shower of colored particles. If one portal
                    is shot into its opposite, the portal will be formed next to the first one, assuming the surface has enough room for it
                    to form; otherwise, it will dissipate as normal. The device can only create two portals at a time. If a third is fired,
                    the other of its type will be automatically closed and a new link will be formed.
                </p>
                <code
                    >The portals fired by the ASHPD each have a distinct color. Chell's ASHPD uses blue and orange (Or red if you look in
                    the settings) portals. ATLAS and P-body each use a variant on those two colors; ATLAS uses light blue and purple
                    portals, while P-body uses yellow and red portals.</code
                >
                <p>
                    The ASHPD also has a zero-point energy field manipulator, similar to the Gravity Gun but far weaker. It can pick up
                    objects, but only those directly in front of it. If the space between the object and the ASHPD is interrupted by a solid
                    object, there is a chance that the object will be dropped, which can sometimes occur when traveling through portals at
                    high velocity and the object accidentally hits the edge of the portal or another object in the surrounding area. It also
                    cannot punt them as the Gravity Gun can, so the only way to throw the object is to physically swing the ASHPD itself,
                    which can at best send the object a few meters away. It cannot catch Aperture Science High Energy Pellets, the
                    equivalent of Combine Energy Balls, due to the weaker manipulator. Items picked up with the ASHPD's manipulator can be
                    carried though portals, which proves to be very useful in several test chambers.

                <p>
                    During Portal, Chell first acquires the ASHPD in Test Chamber 02; it fires only blue portals. It is later upgraded in
                    Test Chamber 11 to fire the orange portals as well (while another model is found there, it actually consists of an
                    upgrade to the current model, as said by GLaDOS). When each of the two versions of the gun are found, they are seen
                    placed on a pedestal in the middle of a Test Chamber. The pedestal is constantly turning on itself, and the ASHPD shoots
                    a portal each time it faces one of the four walls of the room it is in. Chell has to use the non-player controlled gun
                    to complete the Test Chambers and once done acquires the initial ASHPD and later its upgrade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Portal 2, Chell again finds only a single-portal ASHPD near the start of the game. It appears to have been hidden in
                    a Ratman den in the ruined Test Chamber 02 by Doug Rattmann. After GLaDOS is awakened, she loses this one. It falls on
                    the floor in GLaDOS's chamber and is presumably retrieved by GLaDOS. GLaDOS drops her into the furnace, where a
                    fully-functional ASHPD is waiting. Chell loses her ASHPD in the final conflict against Wheatley. When she creates a
                    portal on the moon, the ASHPD is one of the first things sucked through. ATLAS and P-body are provided with
                    fully-functional ASHPDs at the start of their testing.
                </p>
                <code
                    >In the Portal 2 cooperative mode, ATLAS and P-body have their own ASHPDs. They are identifiable by two stripes running
                    along the top rear of the device; blue stripes for ATLAS, and yellow for P-body.</code
                >
            </section>
            <section id="Tactics" class="main-section">

                <p>
                    The ASHPD cannot create portals on every surface. It will not work on certain tiled floors, metal, any kind of prop,
                    doors or windows. However, it will work on security cameras, detaching them and making them fall on the ground. When
                    shooting a portal on an unauthorized surface, the weapon's ray will bounce off and be turned into blue or orange
                    particles that shortly disappear. The surfaces a portal can be created on are the white tiles found in many areas or
                    surfaces covered in conversion gel, which is made of ground-up moon rocks.[2] Portals can also be formed on the moon
                    itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the noted exception of cameras, a portal is incapable of causing physical damage to either humans or objects. If a
                    portal is closed while something is between it and the destination, the object will automatically be pushed out of one
                    or the other, depending on which one the object is closer to. There are a few instances where the player can use portals
                    to kill themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The oval-shaped crosshair/reticle of the ASHPD indicates useful information pertaining to the portals. It first starts
                    with a completely blue crosshair, as the first acquired ASHPD can only shoot blue portals. Later, when the ASHPD is
                    upgraded to shoot orange portals, the crosshair is cut in two parts, blue and orange. In Portal, a smaller oval appears
                    next to the side that has been most recently fired, and when the ASHPD is held in front of a surface where portals
                    cannot be shot, only the outlines of the two oval elements are seen. A filled-in outline indicates a suitable surface.
                    When aimed at an open portal, only the part of the crosshair matching the color of the portal is filled. (Thus
                    reinforcing the fact that portal shots cannot be shot through portals.) In Portal 2 the smaller oval does not exist, and
                    the two oval elements fill when a portal has been fired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shooting an orange portal on an existing blue portal (or vice versa) will create the portal right next to it, if the
                    room available allows it. Otherwise, the shot will dissipate in a shower of particles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will close, or "fizzle", any portal created by the ASHPD. This ensures
                    that the Test Subject starts each new Test Chamber with a "clean" portal network, with their portals confined only to
                    the Test Chamber they are currently in. They also appear within several chambers, forcing the Test Subject to find a way
                    to work around them to complete an otherwise simple task.
                </p>
                <code
                    >The various Test Chambers require the use of several portal-creating techniques, where the ASHPD and momentum play a
                    pivotal part:</code
                >
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The most basic technique is "Flinging," whereby one transforms downward momentum into forward momentum by means of
                        cleverly placed portals. This is mainly used to clear large gaps or obstacles when more orthodox means, such as
                        stairs or lifts, are not available. The concept simply requires one to place one portal facing outward on a high
                        wall across from the area that one wishes to fly over. Meanwhile, the second portal is placed in a nearby pit. By
                        jumping into the portal in the pit, the momentum will "fling" the user through the wall portal and to their
                        destination. A slight variant to this is the "Wedge Fling," where the wall-based portal is instead placed on an
                        upward-slanted, elevated surface for vertical travel as opposed to horizontal travel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A more complex form of "Flinging" is the "Double Fling," performed when lacking a deep enough pit from which to
                        fling. It is performed in the same manner as flinging, but at a reduced height. In the absence of a pit or tall
                        object to jump from, one portal is placed on the floor instead, while the other is placed on the wall as before.
                        Entering into the floor portal will eject the player from the wall portal. As the player falls, they should move the
                        floor portal below them (if necessary) to "catch" themselves. This portal will fling them through the wall portal
                        with their momentum intact, thereby gaining the needed momentum without the use of a pit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the absence of a portal-friendly high wall from which to fling, there is another way to exploit momentum for the
                        purposes of reaching remote ledges: the "Floor-to-Floor" technique. Instead of placing one portal on a high wall, it
                        is instead placed on the floor while the second is placed in a pit. Jumping into the pit ejects the player from the
                        ground-level portal, allowing them to reach a previously unattainable ledge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last technique, advised to be mastered by the player who wants to succeed in the Advanced Chambers, is called
                        "Portal Ledge." It involves standing partway through an already deployed portal and using it as a ledge to reach
                        surfaces beyond the range of the current location. It can literally be used as a ledge to jump from, or another
                        portal can be created from inside it and one can edge one's way toward a distant destination. The latter technique
                        requires the player to exit out of their original portal immediately after placing the second portal, to prevent
                        them from exiting through the original portal. Creatively utilized in this way, the Portal Ledge enables the player
                        to skip large parts of rooms. This is prevented in Portal 2, even though some Portal and Portal: Still Alive maps
                        utilised this technique, as the portal shots in Portal 2 are instant.
                    </li>
                    <li>Other techniques are to be discovered.</li>

                    The concept of shooting blue and orange portals to solve puzzles was directly imported from Narbacular Drop, whose team
                    was hired by Valve to develop that technology into what became Portal.
                </p>
                <code
                    >The earliest known ASHPD model appeared like a modified Gravity Gun. The prongs directly based on that of the latter[3]
                    are still in the final model.</code
                >
                <p>
                    The ASHPD model seen in the Portal trailer features "F-22" written in black on its top,[4] while concept art shows
                    "A-12." It was replaced in the final model by the word "APERTURE" with a barcode and "04/." under it. The end is faded,
                    suggesting more alphanumerics used to come after "04/." This number suggests that the gun used by Chell is a model 4
                    among the gun reserve, or that this model is the fourth version of the gun. In Portal 2, even though the second ASHPD is
                    presumably the same as in Portal, all portal guns have an Aperture decal sticker instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As seen in a very early Portal screenshot, the hands and forearms of the ASHPD user were to be featured in the
                    viewmodel. Chell's right hand and forearm are still present in the final viewmodel, although the texture is broken.
                    However, the texture file can still be found in the game files, revealing what may be an early Aperture Science logo,
                    followed by the number "122-7605," possibly an early Test Subject ID. These are not featured in Chell's model, which
                    probably did not (at least fully) exist at that time of the game's development. Although in Portal: Still Alive and the
                    Xbox version of The Orange Box, the texture is fixed, but still no hand at the bottom; just at the back.
                </p>
                <p>As seen in several early Portal screenshots, a modified Half-Life 2 HUD was first reused.</p>
                <p>
                    As seen in the earliest known Portal screenshots, the orange portal was originally purple. The final colors, blue and
                    orange (again, Red in the options menu), are actually the same as the ones featured in Narbacular Drop, Portal’s
                    predecessor technically speaking. Before being orange (Red in the options menu), the orange (Red in the options menu)
                    portal also was more halfway between yellow and orange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The portals seen in the Portal trailer[4] are slightly different than the retail ones and have purple waves swirling in
                    the middle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The firing sound of the ASHPD when it is still attached to its pedestal originally was the charging sound of the Combine
                    Guard Gun, a weapon cut from Half-Life 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "ASHPD" acronym bears a striking resemblance to Adrian Shephard's name (Adrian SHePharD), which led many players to
                    speculate it is a hidden Easter egg, suggesting Shephard's involvement in Portal or its sequel. Adrian Shephard also
                    used the Black Mesa equivalent known as the Displacement Cannon during the Black Mesa incident, which can be used to
                    self teleport him to Xen and fire a straight-shot portal towards enemies which most likely ends in them being teleported
                    to Xen as well. In addition, completing Portal unlocks a new menu background which contains a keyboard that has all the
                    letters in Adrian Shephard's name highlighted, and these keyboards can also be seen throughout the game. Kim Swift said
                    in an interview that the ASHPD acronym was actually a complete coincidence and that they added the keyboard highlights
                    after people mentioned the acronym.[5] Valve's Doug Lombardi subsequently confirmed the Portal reference as a complete
                    coincidence.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ASHPD in Portal 2 has new firing sounds (although not dissimilar from the originals), as well as new sounds when
                    something goes through a portal. The portals also give off light in their surroundings.

                    With the Razer Hydra controller and Sixense DLC for Portal 2 installed, the ASHPD gains several new abilities, similar
                    in function to the Physgun from Half-Life 2 Beta. In addition to its normal ability to pick up objects, it can extend
                    the beam to move them further away from the player, even through portals, up to a distance of several meters away. It
                    can also physically grab and reorient portals from any distance so long as they remain on a flat, acceptable surface for
                    portals. It cannot move them across wall corners. Solid objects grabbed by the beam can be rotated on all three axes,
                    allowing for precision aiming with the Weighted Pivot Cube. There is also a new type of Cube, the Scaling Cube, which
                    can be manipulated by the ASHPD, allowing the user to make it larger and distort its shape. Doing so also changes the
                    physical properties of the cube; making the cube larger, for example, not only increases its size but also its mass,
                    allowing it to break a pane of glass that it normally could not and crush anything it lands on. These features work in
                    both the single-player campaign and the Sixense map pack included with the DLC. Free aim is enabled in co-op, but all
                    other features are disabled.

                    Typing "impulse 101" in Portal gives all the Half-Life 2 weapons and shows the HUD, where a standing man glyph is used
                    for the ASHPD. The standing man glyph is the same one that shows in Half-Life 2 when a Resistance member is following
                    the player.

                    This is the only Valve game that allows players to kill themselves with their own firearms, excluding grenades/rockets
                    or the 'overcharge' effect of the XVL-1456.</code

                    According to the Aperture Investment Opportunity #4: Boots video, the ASHPD is powered by a miniature black hole, which
                    is kept stable through the use of a cooling fan at the rear of the device. In case the black hole should begin to fail,
                    two miniature German stick grenades, stored within the casing, can be used to restart it, by screwing them into two
                    small holes in the device. Should the fan fail, the device should be disassembled to retrieve the Event Horizon
                    Estimation Wheel, which will determine the minimum safe distance to survive the resulting overload.
